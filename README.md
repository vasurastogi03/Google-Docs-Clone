# Google-Docs-Clone
A Google Docs Clone which is a collaborative text editor. It is made using Node, React, Mongo and Socket.io.

1) The app has the features of a text editor. It creates a new document with a unique ID. And this page with the same URL(containing the same ID) can be opened in multiple tabs of the browser which will show the exact content in each opened tab. This content can be edited by multiple people having the same URL(here document ID) and it will show in each tab the edited contents at the same time( This is the collaborative feature)

2) A new document with a unique ID can be created by going to the root URL (here it is - localhost:3000/). This document will have all the features as described in the first point.

Below is an example showing the features of the application.

Here it can seen that the web pages having the same ID show the same content and can be edited simultaneously in real-time.
